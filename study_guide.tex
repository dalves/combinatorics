\section{Basic Principles}
\subsubsection{Sum Principle}
\[
    \text{ If }A\text{ and }B\text{ are disjoint, }|A \cup B | = |A| + |B|
\]
If you can pick a fruit \textbf{or} a vegetable, then your total number of choices is the number of fruits plus the total number of vegetables.
\subsubsection{Product Principle}
\[
    |A| \times |B| = |A \times B|
\]
If you have $b$ choices for bread and $f$ choices for filling, there are $b\times f$ possible sandwiches that you can make with one bread and one filling.

\subsubsection{Quotient Principle}
\[
    \text{Partitioning }S\text{ into groups of size }k\text{ gives }\frac{|S|}{k}\text{ groups}
\]
If there are $n$ people at a dance, and they are all dancing in pairs at a certain time, there are $\frac{n}{2}$ pairs.

\section{Proofs}
\subsection{Induction}
\subsubsection{Template}

\textbf{Problem Statement:} Prove that for all $n \ge 0$, \emph{blah} is true.\\

We prove this by induction. Let $p(n)$ be the statement that $blah$ is true for $n$. We know that $p(0)$ is true because \emph{something something}. We now show that for all $n \ge 0$, if $p(n)$ is true, $p(n+1)$ must be true. \emph{Something something something}, therefore if $p(n)$ is true, $p(n+1)$ must be true for $n\ge 0$. Therefore for all $n \ge 0$, \emph{blah} is true.
    
\subsubsection{Example}
Show that for all positive integers $n$,
 
\[
    \big(1 + 2 + \ldots + n\big)^2 = 1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + n^3
\]


\begin{proof}
    We prove this by induction on the statement $p(k) = \big(1 + 2 + \ldots + k\big)^2 = 1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + k^3$. For $k = 1$, $p(1)$ gives $1^2 = 1^3$, which is true. For $k > 1$, we show that if $p(k-1)$ is true, then $p(k)$ is true. First note that the sum of integers $1 + 2 + \ldots + x = \frac{x(x+1)}{2} $. Thus $p(k-1)$ can be written as
    
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:squares1}
    \left(\frac{(k-1)k}{2}\right)^2 = 1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + (k-1)^3
    \end{equation}
    
    and $p(k)$ can be written as
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:squares2}
    \left(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\right)^2 = 1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + k^3 
    \end{equation}
    
    Subtracting equation \ref{eq:squares1} from equation \ref{eq:squares2} gives 
    
    \begin{equation*}
    \frac{k^2(k+1)^2 - k^2(k-1)^2}{4} = k^3
    \end{equation*}
    
    Which can be further simplified as follows:
    
    \begin{equation*}
    \frac{(k^2+2k+1) - (k^2-2k+1)}{4} = k   
    \end{equation*}

    or $\frac{4k}{4} = k$. Thus we have shown that if $p(k-1)$ is true, then $p(k)$ is true, which completes the inductive proof.

\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Strong Induction}
Essentially the same as induction, just let $p(n)$ be the statement that \emph{blah} is true for all $k$ where $0 \le k \le n$ instead of only for $n$. 


\subsection{Contradiction}
\subsubsection{Template}
\textbf{Problem Statement:} Prove that \emph{blah} is true.\\

We prove this by contradiction. Assume that \emph{blah} is false. Then \emph{something}, which means \emph{something something}. This contradicts our assumption that \emph{blah} is false. Therefore our assumption is incorrect, so \emph{blah} is true.

\subsubsection{Example}
Consider a complete graph on 6 vertices. Color some of the edges white and some of the edges black. Prove that there must be a triangle with all white edges or all black edges somewhere in the graph. (A triangle with all white edges would be some 3 vertices $a,b,c$ such that the edges $(a,b), (a,c), (b,c)$ are all white)
\begin{proof}
Assume that an edge coloring exists such that each edge is either black or white and there are no all-black or all-white triangles. Consider a vertex $v$. $v$ is connected to the other five vertices by five edges. At least three of these edges must share some color $c$. (If more than three share a color, consider only three of them). Let the three vertices connected to $v$ by $c$-colored edges be $x$, $y$, and $z$. Since $(v,x)$ and $(v,y)$ are colored $c$, $(x,y)$ must be non-$c$-colored otherwise $(v,x), (v,y), (x,y)$ would form a $c$-colored triangle which would contradict our assumption. Similarly since $(v,x)$ and $(v,z)$ are $c$-colored, $(x,z)$ must be non-$c$-colored, and since $(v,y)$ and $(v,z)$ are $c$-colored, $(y,z)$ must be a non-$c$-colored. Since $(x,y)$, $(x,z)$, and $(y,z)$ are all non-$c$-colored, it is an all-black or all-white triangle, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore the assumption is incorrect, and there are no edge colorings on such that there are no all-black or all-white triangles.\\

\section{Equivalence Relations \& Partitions}
\termtable{
    \term{relation} A relation is a subset of $A \times B$. A \say{relation on $A$} is a subset of $A\times A$\\
    \term{equivalence relation} An equivalence relation is a relation that satisfies three properties:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Reflexive: All pairs of the form $(a, a)$ in $A\times B$ are present in the relation
        \item Symmetric: If $(a, b)$ is in the relation, then $(b, a)$ must be in the equivalence relation.
        \item Transitive: If $(a, b)$ and $(b, c)$ are in the relation, then $(a, c)$ must be in the relation.
        \end{itemize}\\
    \term{partition} A partition of a set $S$ is a set of disjoint subsets of $S$ such that the union of those subsets is equal to $S$. For example, $\{\{1,2,4\},\{3,5\}\}$ is a partition of $[5]$ because $\{1,2,4\} \cup \{3,5\} = [5]$ and $\{1,2,4\} \cap \{3,5\} = \emptyset$.

\item Sum of $n^{\text{th}}$ row $\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}=2^n$
\item Sum of even-indexed terms in row $n$ = Sum of odd-indexed terms in row $n$ = Sum of terms in row $n-1$.
\item Sum of diagonal elements (down-and-to-the-left): $\sum_{k=m}^n \binom{k}{m} = \binom{n+1}{m+1}$
\item Sum of diagonal elements (down-and-to-the-right): $\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{m+k}{k} = \binom{m+n+1}{n}$

\section{Probability}


\termtable{
\term{$\Omega$} \emph{Sample Space}, or set of \emph{outcomes}, e.g. coin flip is ${\{H, T\}}$\\
\term{event $E$} Subset of $\Omega$, e.g. $\{H\} \subset \{H, T\}$\\
\term{$E^C$} The \emph{complement} of an event $E \subset \Omega$, or $\Omega\backslash E$\\
\term{event space} The set of events\\
\term{$P:\{0, 1\}^\Omega \rightarrow [0,1]$ } A \emph{probability measure} is a function with domain (subsets of $\Omega$) to a real number in $[0,1]$ subject to the following rules:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $P(\emptyset) = 0$ 
    \item $P(\Omega) = 1$
    \item if $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then $P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$
    \end{enumerate}\\
\term{$P(A|B)$} The \emph{conditional probability} of $A$ given $B$. \[ P(A|B) =\frac{P(A) \cup P(B)}{P(B)} \] \\
\term{random variable} $X: \Omega \rightarrow T$ (usually $T = \mathbb{R}$)\\
\term{distribution of r.v.} For T arbitrary (but discrete) it's a bar graph\\
\term{$E[X]$} The \emph{expectation} given $(T = \mathbb{R})$ is defined as \[ \sum_{x\in T} x P(X=x)\]\\
\term{uniform distribution} All outcomes have equal probability\\
\term{linearity of expectations} $E[X + Y] = E[X] + E[Y]$ Expected number of heads in three flips is equal to number of heads in flip1, number in flip2, number in flip3, therefore $E[X] = 3E[X_i]$ Does not require independence!\\
\term{Baye's theorem} $P(B|A) = \frac{P(B) P(A|B)}{P(A)}$\\

\section{Graphs}

\termtable{
\term{simple graph $G$} Set of vertices $V(G)$ and set of edges $E(G)$\\
\term{$V(G)$} The set of vertices in $G$. Can be any set\\
\term{$E(G)$} The set of edges in $G$. An edge is a set of two \emph{distinct} elements of V(G). $\{v_1, v_2\}: v_1 \neq v_2$\\
\term{directed graph} Same as a simple graph, but edges are length-2 lists, so you can have an edge $(v_1, v_2)$ without the reverse edge $(v_2, v_1)$\\
\term{isomorphism} Two graphs are the same if you rename the vertices. Formally, there exists a bijective function $f: V(G_1) \rightarrow V(G_2)$ such that $\{v, w\} \in E(G_1) \iff \{f(v), f(w)\} \in E(G_2)$ (Note: $\iff$ means \say{if and only if})\\
\term{path} A sequence $v_1 \xrightarrow[e_1]{} v_2 \xrightarrow[e_2]{} v_3 \dots v_k$ where no vertex appears twice\\
\term{cycle} A \emph{path} $v_1 \xrightarrow[e_1]{} v_2 \xrightarrow[e_2]{} v_3 \dots v_1$ which ends at the start vertex\\
\term{tree} A graph with no cycles. There are $n^{n-2}$ trees on $n$ vertices (not expected to prove this)\\
\term{bipartite graph} A graph in which no odd-length cycles exist. The vertices can be divided into disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ such that no two vertices in $A$ are connected by an edge and no two vertices in $B$ are connected by an edge\\
\term{weighted graph} A graph in which each edge has an number\\
\term{$C_n$} A graph on $n$ vertices where all vertices are in one big cycle\\
\term{$K_n$} A \emph{complete} graph on $n$ vertices (all possible edges exist)\\
\term{$K_{n,m}$} A \emph{bipartite} graph with $n$ vertices in one set and $m$ vertices in the other. Every edge between a vertex in $n$ and a vertex in $m$ exists, and no other edges exist.\\
}


\section{Group Actions}

\termtable{
\term{permutation} A function $g: \{1,2,\dots,n \} \rightarrow \{1,2,\dots,n\} $ which is a bijection. Example: $f(1) = 2, f(2) = 4, f(3) = 3, f(4) = 1$. Can be written $\left(\frac{1234}{2431}\right)$ or $(2431)$\\
\term{composition} A composition of permutations $g_1$ and $g_2$ is also a permutation. $g_1(g_2(x))$ is written as $(g_1g_2)(x)$ or $g_1 \circ g_2 (x)$. (Note that you need to apply the permutations from right to left)\\
\term{(id)} The permutation which sends x to itself, e.g. $f(x) = x$\\
\term{associativity} A composition of permutations is associative, meaning $(g_1g_2)g_3 = g_1(g_2g_3)$.\\
\term{inverse} For all $g$, there exists $g^{-1}$ such that $g\circ g^{-1} = \textbf{(id)}$\\
\term{\parbox{4cm}{\raggedleft directed graph notation}} 
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node[shape=circle] (A) at (0,0) {$1$};
\node[shape=circle] (B) at (1,.5) {$2$};
\node[shape=circle] (C) at (2,0) {$3$};
\node[shape=circle] (D) at (2.5,0) {$4$};
\draw [->] (A) edge[bend left=10] (B);
\draw [->] (B) edge[bend left=10] (C);
\draw [->] (C) edge[bend left=10] (A);
\draw [->] (D) edge[loop above,looseness=6] (D);
\end{tikzpicture}
Every permutation can be represented as a directed graph where each node has one incoming edge and one outgoing edge. Every node participates in exactly one cycle.
\\
\term{cycle notation} Expresses a permutation in terms of cycles. The above example is written $(123)(4)$. This is very handy for performing multiplication. To multiply $A\times B$, for each number find the next number in the $B$-cycle, then find the number after that in the $A$-cycle, and put that in the result. As soon as you get back to the first number in your cycle, start a new cycle. Example: $\Big[(123)(465)\Big] \times \Big[(13542)(6)\Big] = (1)(2)(34)(56)$ (First digit: $1\rightarrow3$ in $B$, then $3\rightarrow1$ in $A$, so 1 is in a cycle by itself in the result)\\
